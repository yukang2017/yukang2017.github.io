Hi, this is Yukang Chen (陈玉康)’s website!   
I am a Research Scientist in NVIDIA, working with [Prof. Song Han](https://hanlab.mit.edu/songhan).  
I got my Ph.D. degree in CUHK, supervised by [Prof. Jiaya Jia](https://jiaya.me).  
During my Ph.D. study, I worked closely with [Prof. Xiaojuan Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bGn0uacAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Xiangyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuB-cfoAAAAJ&hl=en).

I focus on Efficient and **Long AI** - **Boosting AI's Long ability while keeping Efficiency**, which covers:
- 🚗 **Long-range AD**: Long-range 3D perception via **sparse convolution**.
- 🚀 **Long-context LLMs**: Efficient fine-tuning of long-context LLMs via **sparse attention**.
- 🎥 **Long-video VLMs**: Scaling VLMs to long videos via **sequence parallelism**.
- 🧠 **Long-sequence Reasoning** Long-sequence RL for LLMs/VLMs via **sequence parallelism**.
- 🎬 **Long-video Generation**: Short→Long AR with efficient fine-tuning via **sparse attention**.
